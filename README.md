### Street Art

Graffiti, a form of street art that often intersects with vandalism, exhibits diverse styles, locations, and legal implications across various countries. In the United States, graffiti is heavily influenced by hip-hop culture, characterized by vibrant murals, intricate tags, and large-scale pieces often found in urban environments like New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago. While some cities embrace graffiti as an art form, offering legal walls and street art festivals, it is still considered illegal in many areas, leading to significant fines and potential jail time for offenders.

In Brazil, particularly in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, graffiti is a prominent part of the urban landscape, blending bold colors and social commentary. Brazilian artists like Os Gêmeos have gained international acclaim, helping to legitimize graffiti as a respected art form. The legal landscape is mixed; while some areas tolerate or even celebrate street art, others impose strict penalties on unauthorized graffiti.

France, especially Paris, boasts a rich graffiti culture influenced by the European hip-hop scene. The art ranges from simple tags to elaborate murals, often seen in the suburbs and along railway lines.

Australia, especially Melbourne, has a thriving street art scene known for its laneway murals and stencil work. The city encourages street art through legal walls and commissioned pieces, although unauthorized graffiti can result in fines and community service.
